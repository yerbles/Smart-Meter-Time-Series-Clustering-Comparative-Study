The "Ausgrid_Customer_16_Clusters.pdf" displays the 16 clusters identified by domain experts, encompassing 268 of the 365 daily load profiles from the Ausgrid customer at the 16th index taken from 01/07/2012 to 30/06/2013. The 365 Min-Max normalised DLPs used in our experiments have been made available through figshare [here](https://figshare.com/projects/Smart-Meter-Time-Series-Clustering-Comparative-Study/226320). The plot shows a pointwise 90 percentile interval for each cluster, as well as the mean and medoid according to the Euclidean distance.
